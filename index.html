    <h3>
      Absolute positioning is positioned relative to closest positioned
      ancestor, if any. Otherwise it is placed relative to the initial
      containing block.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Relative is positioned according to normal flow of the document, and then
      offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom and
      left.
    </h3>
    Eg:
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="child">Absolute</div>
      <div class="child1">Relative</div>
    </div>
    <h3>
      An element with position:fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
      which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Static positioning is the default. It defines the position of a given box
      essentially as an unpositioned element- it flows in the normal rendering
      sequence of the web page.
    </h3>
